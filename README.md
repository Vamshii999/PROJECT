# PROJECT 
=> Introduction 

The Real-Time Feed Ranking System is a robust and scalable solution designed to process, 
analyze, and rank product reviews from Amazon in real-time. The system leverages a 
combination of Apache Kafka, MongoDB, and Django to handle an extensive dataset 
containing nearly 2 billion product reviews. It enables the efficient collection, processing, and 
ranking of reviews based on keywords, tags, and user-generated content. 
With the exponential growth of e-commerce platforms, product reviews have become a critical 
element in consumer decision-making. The challenge, how- ever, lies in efficiently ranking and 
retrieving the most relevant and insightful reviews for users in real time, especially in systems 
with large volumes of data. This project aims to address that challenge by providing a seamless 
and highly responsive platform where users can search and retrieve ranked reviews based on 
various parameters, such as keywords, product tags, and popular or trending tags.

=>Project Objectives 

The objective of this project is to develop a Real-Time Feed Ranking System that efficiently 
processes and ranks product reviews to enhance user experience on e-commerce platforms. The 
system aims to provide a scalable and efficient solution for searching, analyzing, and ranking 
reviews in real-time based on the following key goals: 
1. Real-Time Data Ingestion and Processing: Build a system that can process and stream 
large volumes of product reviews in real-time, leveraging Apache Kafka to handle high
throughput data and ensuring low-latency data transfer from producers to consumers. 
2. Tag Generation and Ranking: Implement a method to automatically generate 
meaningful tags for product reviews using Natural Language Processing (NLP) 
techniques. These tags will be used to rank and categorize reviews, helping users find 
relevant content more efficiently. 
3. Search Functionality with Relevance Ranking: Enable users to search product 
reviews using various filters such as keywords, tags, and top tags. Implement an 
advanced ranking algorithm that prioritizes the most relevant reviews based on factors 
like tag frequency, user sentiment, and keyword relevance. 
4. Scalable Architecture: Design the system to scale efficiently and handle billions of 
product reviews while maintaining high performance. MongoDB will be used to store 
and retrieve product review data, ensuring flexibility and scalability in data 
management. 
5. User-Centric Personalization: Develop a personalized review ranking system that 
adapts to user preferences, showing the most relevant reviews based on their search 
query or interaction with the platform, improving user decision-making. 
6. Optimized Backend and API: Build an optimized backend using Django to provide a 
responsive and efficient API that handles user requests, search queries, and results 
retrieval without delays. 
By achieving these objectives, the system will empower consumers with a more intuitive and 
relevant review search experience, enabling them to make more informed decisions when 
browsing and purchasing products online.
